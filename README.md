## The Problem

Highly valuable Underwriters and Agents, the Subject Matter Experts who possess critical, end-to-end product knowledge, are currently sidelined by a manual process that forces their expertise into static specifications. This results in a dangerous knowledge bottleneck where requirements must be translated across multiple roles (SME → Product Owner → Developer), functioning like a costly game of telephone. As a direct consequence, crucial product intent is lost by the time development begins, virtually guaranteeing the introduction of unnecessary bugs and forcing multiple unplanned development cycles for constant rework. This reliance on manual knowledge transfer and document handoffs significantly delays time-to-market and leads to the waste of highly-paid expert time and operational budget.

## Goals

- The first truly no-code, cloud-native rating engine built for insurers, MGAs, and brokers.
- Drag-and-drop rule builder — no developers required.
- Real-time sandbox testing and instant deployment.
- Auto-generated APIs endpoints.
- Full audit trail and versioning for compliance.
